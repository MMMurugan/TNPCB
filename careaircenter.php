                    In order to monitor both source emissions and ambient air quality on a real-time basis, TNPCB has established a Centre for Accessing Real Time Air (Quality) Information Report (CARE AIR) at the Head office of the Board. This is a continuous real-time emission monitoring system which is functioning 24 X 7.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mt-4" style="text-align: justify;">
                    This is the first of its kind in the whole country and has been appreciated by the Government of India. When the emission levels exceed the prescribed norms, an inbuilt alarm system informs the concerned industry and the District Environmental Engineer/Member Secretary through automated SMS for immediate remedial action.
                </p>
                <p class="lead mt-4" style="text-align: justify;">
                    Many large-scale industries have been connected to the CARE AIR Centre, and their emissions are monitored continuously. In addition to monitoring air quality, the discharge of effluents has also been included in the monitoring system.
